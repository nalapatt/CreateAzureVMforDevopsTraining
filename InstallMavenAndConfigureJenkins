#Here you will learn how to download Maven and configure Maven,Git and JDK in Jenkins to build Maven jobs in Jenkins
Create an Azure VM
Configure Port 8080 for Jenkins
Install Jenkins 
#Download Maven
in a new tab open https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
Download apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip ( if this downloads on your local machine instead of in the VM either download filezilla to transfer the files into the VM
or use SCP or FTP to copy the files from your local to the azure VM)
check is the zip file is dowloaded in the terminal
unzip apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip in the terminal
In Jenkins go to Manage Jenkins
Go to Global Tool Configuration
Press Maven installations
Give a Maven name (any name you want)
Give the path ( in my case it is /home/username/apache-maven-3.6.3/ to check what the path is type pwd)
untick install automatically
Press JDk installations
Give a JDK name ( any name)
Give the path ( in my case it is usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64 )(to find path type this, update-alternatives --list java 
(the path is the ones before the jdk file)
untick install automatically
Press Git installations
Give a Git name (I gave git)
Give the path ( in my case it is /usr/bin/git to check what the path is type which git)
untick install automatically
Save
Hooray now your Maven,JDK and Git is configured in Jenkins
(if JDK and Git is not installed in your VM go to the relevant documents which will guide you that is InstallGitInAzureVM and InstallJenkinsInAzureVM)
