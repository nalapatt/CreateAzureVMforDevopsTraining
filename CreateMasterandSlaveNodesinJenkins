Go to Jenkins Master Slave Configuration | Demo | On AWS EC2
By Let's Go Tech In a Cloudy Way
for a great youtube video

First create 2 instances in AWS as Jenkins master and Jenkins Slave
Download your ssh key and store it in a safe place

Connect to Jenkins master on your terminal
cd Downloads
chmod 400 yourkey.pem
ssh -i "yourkey.pem" ubuntu@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com
Install Java and Maven
Install jenkins
Connect to the Jenkins UI
All this is elaborated in the document InstallJenkinsInAzureVM and InstallMavenAndConfigureJenkins

next Connect to the slave node on your terminal 
cd Downloads
ssh -i "yourkey.pem" ubuntu@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com
sudo su
pwd
mkdir jenkins
pwd ( this is the path you are going to use in configuring the node as your remote directory)
ls -lrt ( this will show your new directory jenkins
Install Java and Maven
 
next Go to Jenkins UI
go to Manage Jenkins
Manage Nodes
Now you see Master already configured
Create a New Node 
Name it Jenkins-slave1
select Permanent Agent
Configure the agent
Name : Jenkins-slave-1
Description	:This is the slave1 where code is compiled
# of executors	:1
Remote root directory	:/home/ubuntu/jenkins (this is the path that we noted when we connected to the terminal and created 
Labels:	Jenkins-compile-slave (keep a note of this it will be used later when building a job)
Usage	:Use this node as much as possible
Launch method	:Launch agents via SSH
Host	: xxx.xx.xx.xxx (the public Ip address of the AWS EC2 slave instance , this is found in the instance details/info)
Credentials	:Add Drop down window choose jenkins
this takes you to another window
fill in the details in that window

Add Credentials
Domain	:Global credentials (unrestricted)
Kind	:ssh username with private key
Scope	:Global (Jenkins, nodes, items, all child items, etc)
Username:ubuntu	
Private Key :Enter directly
Add : Copy and Paste key from terminal 
( Go back to the terminal , cd Downloads , cat yournamekey.pem , copy the entire key from startof private key to end of private key)
Press Add
it goes back to the Node Window 
Continue with 
ID	:JenkinsSlave
Description	:JenkinsSlave

Credentials	:ubuntu (jenkins-slave1)
Host Key Verification Strategy	:Manually trusted key Verification Strategy
Availability	:Keep this agent online as much as possible

Save This 

You will now see the Slave Node Configured 
Click on it and launch it , go to the Log , if it says agent successfully connected Hooray

Now if you go to create a new item
and in General select: Restrict where this project can be run
Label Expression	: Jenkins-compile-slave ( this is the label you used when configuring the slave node, hope you memorized it 
otherwise go to the node and get the label name from the node configuration)
Execute shell echo "hello from slave"
Build

Yeah you have run the first build job which runs it in the slave
